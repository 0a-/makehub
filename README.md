Welcome to Makehub

## Setup development environment

We recommend you to develop on Cloud9 IDE http://c9.io
Just fork the project on github and then open it using Cloud9 IDE.

To start the server, you'll need to pass in the following cmd line args to the node server.js command:
```--host=https://your-host-name.c9.io --github-client-id=aaabbbccc111222333 --github-client-secret=aaabbbccc111222333aaabbbccc111222333.```

To get a github-client-id and a github-client-secret, go to https://github.com/settings/applications and register a new application.
